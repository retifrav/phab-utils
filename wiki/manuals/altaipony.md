## Installing

### From PyPI

``` sh
$ pip install altaipony
```

Current version (*[2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/altaipony/2.0.0/)*) has strict dependencies on several obsolete packages, so probably don't install it from PyPI.

### From sources

Older versions had various problems, you can find instructions for those in [cec1bd33dbcc3d9bd1823a5b6cdb40b20843c9be](https://github.com/retifrav/uio-exoplanet-group/blob/cec1bd33dbcc3d9bd1823a5b6cdb40b20843c9be/wiki/manuals/altaipony.md#from-sources).

Newer versions seem to install without problems:

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ekaterinailin/AltaiPony.git
$ cd ./AltaiPony
$ pip install cython
$ pip install .
```
